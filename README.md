The expected rendering is a website made in React containing 3 pages (Home, The agency, Projects).

The created components will be functional components.

3 other pages are expected (PLATON, Solane, Sedal), one for each of the case studies.

As you can imagine, these 3 pages are in fact one and the same component, in which different datas are displayed depending on the URL. So it's dynamic routing.

The language of the site is manageable thanks to a flag that varies between an English flag and a French flag, depending on the available language. The selected language is stored in the localStorage, for a future visit.

Several possibilities are available to you at the URL level: you can choose to have only one URL for each page (/, /about, /works), in English.

If, on the other hand, you have been very fast for this project and you like the challenge, I invite you to create a system allowing you to have 2 valid URLs for each project: one in English, the other in French. The same goes for the URLs of the 3 case studies.
